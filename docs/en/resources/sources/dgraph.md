## About

[Dgraph][dgraph-docs] is an open-source graph database. It is designed for real-time workloads, horizontal scalability, and data flexibility. Implemented as a distributed system, Dgraph processes queries in parallel to deliver the fastest result.

This source can connect to either a self-managed Dgraph cluster or one hosted on
Dgraph Cloud. If you're new to Dgraph, the fastest way to get started is to
[sign up for Dgraph Cloud][dgraph-login].

[dgraph-login]: https://cloud.dgraph.io/login

## Requirements

### Database User

When **connecting to a hosted Dgraph database**, this source uses the API key
for access. If you are using a dedicated environment, you will additionally need
the namespace and user credentials for that namespace.

For **connecting to a local or self-hosted Dgraph database**, use the namespace
and user credentials for that namespace.

## Example

```yaml
sources:
    my-dgraph-source:
        kind: dgraph
        dgraphUrl: https://xxxx.cloud.dgraph.io
        user: ${USER_NAME}
        password: ${PASSWORD}
        apiKey: ${API_KEY}
        namespace : 0
```

{{< notice tip >}}
Use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.
